# Spotify Sync Tool

A tool that helps you download and update Spotify playlists on your harddrive, so you can keep your music library updated offline as mp3s.
By pressing the "sync" button, all songs of the entered playlists are downloaded into respective playlist folders

## Usage

Install the tool with python

Since this tool relies on spotify_dl to parse the Spotify songs, you need to create a Spotify Developer account 
and export the 'client_id' and 'client_secret' environment variables. Then, spotipy_should be able to download songs.
For further reference, have a look at the spotify_dl documentation (https://github.com/SathyaBhat/spotify-dl)
