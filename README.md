2. Create a .env and add `client_id=<your_spotify_client_id` and `client_secret=<your_spotify_client_secret> to it.
3. Execute `main.exe`

### From Source

1. `pip install` the dependencies
2. Create a .env and add `client_id=<your_spotify_client_id` and `client_secret=<your_spotify_client_secret> to it.
3. Run the program with `python3 main.py`

## Usage

Install the tool with python

Since this tool relies on spotify_dl to parse the Spotify songs, you need to create a Spotify Developer account 
and export the 'client_id' and 'client_secret' environment variables. For further reference, have a look at the spotify_dl documentation (https://github.com/SathyaBhat/spotify-dl)

Then, spotipy_should be able to download songs.
